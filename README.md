# Manual Tests Performed

* **Scenario:** Create booking with all inputs in their default state (Empty)
  **Result:** Booking creation fails. Further inspection of the network logs reveal a server error (500). Possibly because inputs fail validation on the server side (Should not be null or empty)

* **Scenario Outline:** Create booking with price having a non numeric/decimal value
  **Result:** Booking creation fails. Further inspection of the network logs reveal a server error (500). Possibly because input validation fails on price attribute as it expects a numeric/decimal value
  **Examples:**
    | values  |
    | text    |
    | 100.0.1 |
    | %$@Â£    |

* **Scenario:** Create booking with all fields filled out appropriately
  **Result:** Booking creation passes. Booking appears in the list of bookings with all details rendered. Also inspection of the network logs shows a success response (200)

* **Scenario:** Create booking with check-out date in the past and check-in date in the future
  **Result:** Booking creation passes. It seems asides the basic validation of ensuring the dates are formatted correctly there are no further validations on the dates to check if they are in range of each other.

* **Scenario:** Delete a non-existent booking ID by modifying the ID in the delete button
  **Result:** Booking cannot be deleted. On further inspection of the network logs we get a "method not allowed" error (405) indicating the ID used does not exist

* **Scenario:** Successfully delete a booking
  **Result:** Booking is deleted and disappears from the list of bookings table.

* **Scenario:** Incorrectly formatted checkin date using input field
  **Examples:**
    | input      |
    | 28-02-2022 | # DD-MM-YYYY
    | 2022-28-02 | # YYYY-DD-MM
  **Result:** Booking creation fails. Further inspection of the network logs reveal a server error (500). Expected date format is YYYY-MM-DD or MM-DD-YYYY

* **Scenario:** Incorrectly formatted checkout date using input field
  **Examples:**
    | input      |
    | 28-02-2022 | # DD-MM-YYYY
    | 2022-28-02 | # YYYY-DD-MM
  **Result:** Booking creation fails. Further inspection of the network logs reveal a server error (500). Expected date format is YYYY-MM-DD or MM-DD-YYYY

# Test Automation

## Pre-requisites
* Google Chrome Browser - You can install chrome for your OS from [here](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/)
* Firefox Browser (Optional) - You can install firefox for your OS from [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/)
* NodeJS - You can install nodeJS for your OS from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

## Setup
In your DOS/Unix terminal

* Change directory into the root of this project using command `cd path/to/root/directory/of/this/project`
* Install project dependencies using NPM by running `npm -i`

## To run tests using the cypress runner dashboard
In your DOS/Unix terminal
* Execute the following command to open the cypress test runner `npm run open`
* You should see the following ![window](/images/cypress_runner_dashboard.png) showing you the test runner.
* Select `Chrome` | `Firefox` from the list of browsers depending on what you have got installed
* Then select the `booking_form.feature` test and it should start executing

## To run tests using the runner from the command line (DOS/Unix Terminal)
In your DOS/Unix terminal
* Execute the following command to execute the test feature on Chrome browser please execute `npm run regression:chrome`
* To Execute the tests against firefox. Please install the latest firefox web browser and run `npm run regression:firefox`

## Test Results
Depending on how you execute the tests the results will be generated differently.

* Using the cypress runner dashboard, you will have to subscribe to cypress dashboard to push results up to the cloud. 
* Using the command line, cypress generates several reports
  * Screenshots: Screenshots are generated at point of failure by default and stored in the `cypress/screenshots` directory. Also they are named using the scenario title and should be able to help you debug why a test has failed and what scenario failed.
  * Videos: Videos are generated at the end of the entire test run and stored in the `cypress/videos` directory. They are generated by default unless turned off in the `cypress.json` configuration. You can view the entire test run and debug failures using this.
  * Custom Reports: As a bonus you can add custom reports in different formats e.g html, json e.t.c. For this project I have included mochawesome as a report generator but turned it off. If you will like reports generated in JSON or HTML formats using mochawesome edit the `cypress.json` file setting `html` or `json` to `true` in the `reporterOptions`. These will generate reports outside the `cypress` directory.
